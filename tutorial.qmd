## The Developer's Monday

It's 9:00 AM. You sit down at your desk with a coffee that's already getting cold. Your inbox has 47 unread emails, Slack is buzzing, and you have a vague sense that something is due today.

**How will you survive?** Using the `deepworks` package, we can transform chaos into focused productivity.

### Starting the Day Right

Before diving into the abyss of notifications, let's get centered. The `get_affirmation` function provides personalized motivation based on your current state.

```{python}
from deepworks.affirmation import get_affirmation

# Monday morning reality check
name = "Developer"
mood = "stressed"
energy = 4  # Coffee hasn't kicked in yet

affirmation = get_affirmation(name=name, mood=mood, energy=energy)

print(f"Category: {affirmation['category']}")
print(f"\n\"{affirmation['text']}\"")
```

### Planning Your Focus Time

You have 2 hours before the standup meeting. Let's make them count with a structured work schedule using the Pomodoro technique.

```{python}
from deepworks.pomodoro import plan_pomodoro

# 2 hours of available time
available_minutes = 120

schedule = plan_pomodoro(total_minutes=available_minutes, technique="pomodoro")

# Calculate summary stats from the schedule
work_sessions = len(schedule[schedule["type"] == "work"])
total_work = schedule[schedule["type"] == "work"]["duration_minutes"].sum()
total_breaks = schedule[schedule["type"] != "work"]["duration_minutes"].sum()

print(f"Work sessions planned: {work_sessions}")
print(f"Total work time: {total_work} minutes")
print(f"Total break time: {total_breaks} minutes")
print()
schedule
```

The classic Pomodoro technique uses 25-minute work blocks with 5-minute breaks. But maybe you prefer longer focus sessions?

```{python}
# Try the 52-17 technique for deeper focus
deep_schedule = plan_pomodoro(total_minutes=available_minutes, technique="52-17")

print("52-17 Technique Schedule:")
deep_schedule
```
